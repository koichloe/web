          <td><p>So if you are looking for someone with that has more chilled music and upbeat ones, then I recommend this korean artist known as <strong>IU</strong>!
              She has one of the best discography out of all the korean artists I know, and one of the best voices ever.
              She recently release a song that got immediately added to my playlist so you should definitely check her out.
              Here's a link to her new song called <a href="https://youtu.be/0-q1KafFCLU">Celebrity by IU</a></p></td></tr>

        <td><p>I wanted to introduce this group called <strong>Day6</strong> because unlike the normal recommendations, they're a kband (korean band). 
              As in each member plays a different instrument and they compose/write all of their songs themselves. 
              I would greatly recommend them to anyone that's interested in rock and instrumental music because they're definetly a great choice. 
              Here's a link to one of my favorite song of theirs called <a href="https://youtu.be/BS7tz2rAOSA">You were Beautiful by Day6</a></p></td></tr>
