          <td><p>So if you are looking for someone with that has more chilled music and upbeat ones, then I recommend this korean artist known as IU!
              She has one of the best discography out of all the korean artists I know, and one of the best voices ever.
              She recently release a song that got immediately added to my playlist so you should definitely check her out.
              Here's a link to her new song called "Celebrity" <a href="https://youtu.be/0-q1KafFCLU">Celebrity by IU</a></p></td></tr>
