          <td><p>So if you are looking for someone with that has more chilled music and upbeat ones, then I recommend this korean artist known as IU!!
              She has one of the best discography out of all the korean artists I know, and one of the best voices ever.
              She's also one of the kindest idol to ever exist so Stan IU wooooo!!
              She recently release a song that got immediately added to my playlist so you should definitely check her out.
              Here's a link to her new song called <a href="https://youtu.be/0-q1KafFCLU">Celebrity by IU</a></p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="https://media.starbiz.net/2020/05/day6-suffers-severe-stress-as-fans-follow-them-everywhere.jpg" width="450" length="500"></td> 
        <td><p>I wanted to introduce this group called Day6 because unlike the normal recommendations, they're a kband (korean band). 
              As in each member plays a different instrument and they compose/write all of their songs themselves. 
              I would greatly recommend them to anyone that's interested in rock and instrumental music because they're definetly a great choice. 
              Here's a link to one of my favorite song of theirs called <a href="https://youtu.be/BS7tz2rAOSA">You were Beautiful by Day6</a></p></td></tr>

          <td><p>Last but certianly not least is Chungha!! She is one of the best performers in the kpop industry, her dancing talent is undeniably one
              of the best in kpop. And on top of that all of her songs are perfect bops for any occasion. 
              Each song of hers may sound different but you can tell that they all have the unique "Chungha" style. 
              Here's a link to a song she recently released called <a href="https://youtu.be/_waD9YW8Pa8">Bicycle by Chungha</a> Stream Bicycle Woo!!</p></td></tr>
