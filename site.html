    Welcome to my site where I list some music reccomendations I have for you to listen to~
    My music taste consists of more soft and chill songs for those who are interested in that
    but it differs between each genre. I usually listen to kpop, regular pop and other types of music.<br>
    For Korean songs, I mainly listen to a lot of vocal based songs that can make me feel relaxed<br>
    For English songs, I try to listen to happy and exciting songs that make you feel good as well as calmer songs<br>
    For No Lyric songs, I tend to love the ones with beat heavy ones, like the ones I can nod my head to<br>
    So click the one in the menu that you seem to be interested in the most !! ^-^
