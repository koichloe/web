    Welcome to my website where I list some music reccomendations I have for you to listen to~<br>
    My music taste usually consists of more soft and chill songs for those who are interested in that<br> 
    but it differs between each genre<br>
    For Korean songs, I mainly listen to a lot of vocal based songs that can make me feel relaxed<br>
    For English songs, I try to listen to happy and exciting songs that make you feel good on top of calming songs<br>
    For No Lyric songs, I tend to love the ones with more beats that I can nod my head to<br>
    So click the one in the menu that you seem to be interested in the most !! ^-^
