      <td><p>I want to introduce an artist that I listen to a lot on the daily, known as Keshi!
             I love how you can play his music in any scenario like on the train to school, or right before you sleep.
             All of his songs are really good and have the same vibe so it's easy to put his music on suffle without worrying about a sudden mood change in his songs.
             He also has an amazing voice as well :)<br>
             Here's a link to his spotify page <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3pc0bOVB5whxmD50W79wwO?si=VUopyU8HSv-G1KO3Yv0gog">Keshi on Spotify</a>!!</p></td></tr>

    <td><p>I'm a huge fan of R&B music, and this artist has the definition of R&B music to my taste. And her name is NIKI!!
           I love the way her voice sounds so angelic and easy to listen to. Her music still has a upbeat but lowkey a vibe ;)
           I feel like she's an artist that you can listen to the car on a drive. so...
           here's a link to her spotify page <a href="spotify:artist:2kxP07DLgs4xlWz8YHlvfh">NIKI on Spotify</a>!!</p></td></tr>
