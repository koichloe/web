  <h1> Artist's Songs on the Billboard Charts </h1>
  <h3> [ made by Chloe Peng - Period 5 ] </h3>
  <br>
  <h2> Project Overview </h2>
    <p> This is a python program that will show the songs of an artist (typed in by the user) 
      that have made it onto the Billboard's Hot 100's songs from the years 2000 - 2021. By using a data set of all the songs that have 
      been on the weekly Billboard Hot 100's Charts since 1958, the python code and analysis and read through the data set and determine 
      the songs of an artist that were on there. The data set includes a lot of information but it doesn't include the highest position 
      a song has ever reached on the charts. Which is why I included a way it could determine each song's peak position on the charts 
      in my python code. 
    </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <p> After running the program, it'll ask you to input an artist (singer, band, group etc.)
      name and then click enter. Make sure to spell it exactly as the way they're known by (and same with capitalization / spacing)! 
    </p>
  <br>
  <h2> How does it Work? </h2>
    <p> By using the input() function in python, the user is able to input an artist of their choice.
      And after the program acquires the name of an artist, it goes through multiple functions to find the songs of that artist in the
      data set. I created a modified list function that cuts the orignal data set into a list of lists that includes all the information 
      of each songs that were on the charts from the 2000's as an element of that list. And then another function searches through the 
      modifed list to find every list in that list that has a song by the artist. Then, it reorganizes the lists of every time a song
      by the artist has been on the charts into a dictionary where the keys are all the songs that's appeared and the values is a list
      of all the position the song has ever been on the charts. Then, it changes the values of the dictionary into a list of only the
      highest position the song has ever been on the charts by running an outside function that would determine the smallest value in
      a list. And the final part of the program prints out the name of an aritst and then it's peak position.

  <h2> Files </h2>
    <p> final_project.py -- the python function written through thonny that accomplishes the function of this project 
        <br>
        Hot_Stuff.csv -- the csv file that has information on each song that has been on the Weekly Billboard Hot 100 Charts
        <br>
        final.html -- the html file that creates this webpage hosted through github
        <br>
        styles.css -- the css file that styled this webpage
    </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Resources </h2>
      <a href = https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017> Dataset <a>
        <p> This was the offical site that I got my dataset from and with all the information it had, I could do a lot with it but I 
          created one for this project. The dataset includes information like:
           <ul> 
             <li> Billboard Chart URL </li>
             <li> WeekID </li>
             <li> Song name </li>
             <li> Performer name </li>
             <li> SongID - combination of song & performer </li>
             <li> Current week on chart </li>
             <li> Instance (states whata  this song has appeared on the chart) </li>
             <li> Previous week position </li>
             <li> Peak Position of the corresponding week </li>
             <li> Weeks on Chart (as of the corresponding week) </li>
           </ul>
        </p>
     <br>
  <h2> Bugs, Errors and Things User Should be Aware of </h2>
     <p> <ul>
          <li> The user has to type in the name of the artist in the exact same way that they're known by (like Ariana Grande, and niki) </li>
          <li> I limited the information from the charts to only songs from 2000 to 2021 because the file was originally too big </li>
        <ul>
     </p>
