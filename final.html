  <h1> Artist's Songs on the Billboard Charts </h1>
  <h3> [ made by Chloe Peng - Period 5 ] </h3>
  <br>
  <h2> Project Overview </h2>
    <p> This is a python program that will show the songs of an artist (typed in by the user) 
      that have made it onto the Billboard's Hot 100's songs from the years 2000 - 2021. By using a data set of all the songs that have 
      been on the weekly Billboard Hot 100's Charts since 1958, the python code and analysis and read through the data set and determine 
      the songs of an artist that were on there. The data set includes a lot of information but it doesn't include the highest position 
      a song has ever reached on the charts. Which is why I included a way it could determine each song's peak position on the charts 
      in my python code. </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <p> After running the program, it'll ask you to input an artist (singer, band, group etc.)
      name and then click enter. Make sure to spell it exactly as the way they're known by (like capitalization and spacing)! </p>
  <br>
  <h2> How does it Work? </h2>
    <p> By using the input() function in python, the user is able to input an artist of their choice.
      And after the program acquires the name of an artist, it goes through each element of a modified list of the original data set. The
      modified list cuts the orignal data set into only songs that were on the charts from the 2000's.
